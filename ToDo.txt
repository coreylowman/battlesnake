To do list:

- aggression
    - force collision with smaller snake
    - box them in?
    - apporach: maybe just move toward their head shortest path? switch to this when we have 'enough' food?
- is there a point where we should stop eating?
 - the comsole output when there are errors seems to go back severl hours, even though the window has been cleared.  Is there something that needs to eb released or something?


Done:
- switch from random move selection to some kind of weighted selection
- avoid potential collision with higher health snakes
- go after food we are closest to
- deal with hazards
    - fix bug that while we're in hazards there are no valid moves, so no way out
- tail options
    - the place where our tail is a safe move unless the tail is stacked (we ate last turn, stacked same as at game start)
    - another snake's tail is a safe move unless the tail is stacked
- don't box ourselves in - floodfill
- latency?


Not at this time:
- deal with hazards
    - do we want to get food from hazards?  (this might be good or bad...)
- shortest path instead of manhattan distance
